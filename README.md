## About
Blackwell has been a successful electronics retailer for over three decades, 
with over numerous stores in various locations. A little over a year ago 
Blackwell launched an eCommerce website. They are starting to build up customer 
transaction data from the site and want to leverage this data to inform business 
decisions about site-related activities, like online marketing, enhancements to 
the site and so on, in order to continue to maximize the amount of revenue 
generated from eCommerce sales.
